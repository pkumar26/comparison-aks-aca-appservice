## 🤝 How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Issues

Found a bug, outdated information, or error? Please:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the bug report template** when creating an issue
3. **Provide specific details**:
   - File name and location
   - What's incorrect and what it should say
   - Evidence or sources (official Azure docs)
4. **Label appropriately**: `bug`, `documentation`

### Suggesting Enhancements

Have ideas for improvements? We welcome:

- New decision criteria
- Additional scenarios
- Better visualizations
- Tools or calculators
- Documentation improvements

**Use the feature request template** and explain:
- What problem it solves
- Your proposed solution
- Who would benefit

### Contributing Documentation

#### Documentation Standards

- **Accuracy**: All information must be current and verifiable
- **Clarity**: Write for diverse audiences (beginners to experts)
- **Structure**: Follow existing document structure and formatting
- **Links**: Use official Microsoft documentation as primary sources
- **Examples**: Include real-world examples where helpful

#### Documentation Files

| Directory | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| `docs/` | Comprehensive guides, comparisons, resources | As Azure services evolve |
| `diagrams/` | Mermaid flowcharts and decision trees | When decision logic changes |
| `README.md` | Repository overview and summary | When major changes occur |

### Modifying Diagrams

#### Mermaid Diagram Guidelines

Located in `diagrams/` directory:

1. **Edit `.mmd` files directly** (not `.md` files)
2. **Test locally** before submitting:
   ```bash
   # Install mermaid-cli
   npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
   
   # Generate PNG to verify
   mmdc -i diagrams/decision-tree-vertical.mmd -o test-output.png
   ```

3. **Follow existing syntax**:
   - Use `flowchart TB` for vertical diagrams
   - Use `flowchart LR` for horizontal diagrams
   - Maintain consistent node naming (Q1, Q2, AKS1, ACA1, etc.)
   - Use subgraphs for logical grouping
   - Include confidence indicators (✅, ⚠️, ℹ️)

4. **Update both orientations**: If you modify logic, update both `decision-tree-vertical.mmd` and `decision-tree-horizontal.mmd`

5. **Don't edit auto-generated files**: PNG/SVG exports in `diagrams/exports/` are generated by GitHub Actions

#### Diagram Quality Checklist

- [ ] All decision paths lead to outcomes
- [ ] No orphaned nodes
- [ ] Consistent styling (colors, shapes)
- [ ] Legend included and accurate
- [ ] Node labels are clear and concise
- [ ] Both vertical and horizontal versions updated

### Submitting Scenarios

Real-world scenarios help others! When submitting:

1. **Use the scenario request template**
2. **Include**:
   - Detailed scenario description
   - Key technical requirements
   - Team size and expertise
   - Budget constraints
   - Compliance needs
   - Why existing scenarios don't fit

3. **Good scenario examples**:
   - E-commerce platform with Black Friday traffic
   - IoT device telemetry processing
   - Multi-tenant SaaS application
   - Machine learning training pipeline

4. **Structure** (if you're writing the scenario):
   ```markdown
   ## Scenario: [Name]
   
   ### Context
   [Business context and background]
   
   ### Requirements
   - Technical requirement 1
   - Technical requirement 2
   
   ### Decision Process
   [How to evaluate using the decision tree]
   
   ### Recommendation
   [Which service and why]
   
   ### Why Not Alternatives?
   [Why other services don't fit as well]
   ```

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create an issue first** (for significant changes)
2. **Fork the repository**
3. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. **Make your changes**
5. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Verify Mermaid diagrams render correctly
   - Check all links work
   - Review formatting

### PR Requirements

- **Descriptive title**: `[Type] Brief description`
  - Types: `[Docs]`, `[Diagram]`, `[Scenario]`, `[Fix]`, `[Enhancement]`
- **Complete description**:
  - What changes were made
  - Why they were needed
  - Related issue number (`Fixes #123`)
- **Checklist completed**:
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Documentation follows style guidelines
  - [ ] All links tested and working
  - [ ] Diagrams render correctly
  - [ ] No typos or grammar errors
  - [ ] Changes are based on official Azure documentation
  ```

### Review Process

1. Maintainer reviews within 3-5 business days
2. Address any feedback or requested changes
3. Once approved, maintainer will merge
4. GitHub Actions will auto-generate diagram exports

### After Merge

- Your contribution will be credited in commit history
- Diagrams will be auto-exported to PNG/SVG
- Documentation will be live immediately

## 📝 Style Guidelines

### Markdown

- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, not underlines)
- One blank line before and after headers
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Tables: Use proper alignment, include headers
- Lists: Use `-` for unordered, `1.` for ordered
- Links: Descriptive text, not "click here"

### Writing Style

- **Tone**: Professional but approachable
- **Voice**: Second person ("you") for guides, third person for descriptions
- **Tense**: Present tense for current state, future tense for predictions
- **Abbreviations**: Define on first use, use consistently
- **Bias**: Remain neutral, present pros/cons fairly

### Technical Content

- **Azure service names**: Use official names and capitalization
  - ✅ Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  - ❌ azure kubernetes service, AKS service
- **Links**: Prefer docs.microsoft.com over other sources
- **Versions**: Mention when information is version-specific
- **Deprecations**: Note if features are in preview or deprecated

### Code Examples

- Use proper syntax highlighting
- Include comments for clarity
- Test all code snippets
- Provide context for examples
